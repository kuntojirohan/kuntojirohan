## Heyya!! 👋

Welcome to my humble abode on the GitHub world!! I'm Rohan Kuntoji (he/him) 👨‍🎓  

### 💫 About Me:
I'm currently pursuing Master's in Financial Data Science (MScFDS) at UCD Michael Smurfit Business School in Dublin, Ireland. I completed the Portfolio Manager Micro-Degree Certification offered by the Financial Edge Institute, London, which helped me develop hands on skills in financial modelling, valuation, portfolio construction, security selection (equities and fixed-income) and asset allocation. I have had the opportunity to put my learnings to practice in my current role as a portfolio manager for the Student Managed Fund at UCD. I graduated First Class with a Bachelor of Engineering from SJCE Mysore, India, in 2018, majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

Before joining UCD, I gained 3+ years of industry experience in the fast growing Indian tech start-up ecosystem. I worked on data science and machine learning at a boutique AI research firm (focusing on FinTech projects), before joining the founding team at Dello+ in 2020 to work toward revolutionising the digital healthcare services in India and across the world. This entrepreneurial experience pushed me to understand the various facets of business operations - finance, market research & analysis, product development and stakeholder management. Most importantly, it equipped me with a strong work ethic, problem-solving skills, and an analytical mindset.

* 📚 Working toward achieving the CAIA (Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst) Charter; preparing for Sep '23 L1 exam

* ✨ Fun fact: I play ukulele everyday 🎸; learning French (Bonjour!); love reading and listening podcasts on business and finance
